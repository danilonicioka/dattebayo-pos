Build Missing Android Client Dependency
The Android app build is failing because it depends on a JAR file (restaurant-pos-android-client-1.0.0.jar) that is supposed to be generated by the clients/android-client Maven project. This JAR is currently missing.

User Review Required
None. This is a standard build dependency issue.

Proposed Changes
No code changes are required. The fix involves running the build command for the dependency.

Build Steps
Run mvn clean install in clients/android-client to generate the JAR file.
This project uses openapi-generator-maven-plugin to generate code from contracts/openapi.yaml.
Verification Plan
Automated Tests
Verify JAR existence: Check that clients/android-client/target/restaurant-pos-android-client-1.0.0.jar exists after the Maven build.
Verify Android Build: Run ./gradlew assembleDebug in the android directory and confirm it completes successfully.
Manual Verification
None required if these commands succeed.
